# mixedMessages
Codecademy Full Stack Developer course project

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. 
To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 
Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

## Prerequisites:
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

# My Takeaway
My implementation was fairly simple. I used Dungeons & Dragons as an inspiration. 
It generates one sentence, randomly determining a character's race and class,
and what action they decide to take. I don't believe my implementation is sophisticated in any way,
and gets straight to the point of the assignment. 

If I want to extend it, I would add logic to only allow certain combinations of race/class/action be available to eachother.
For example, a halfing rouge is a common character and would be allowed, however a half-orc wizard is almost unheard of, and my program 
would perhaps never allow that combination. As well as actions, spellcasters would have the ability to 'cast a spell' whereas a 
barbarian wouldn't, etc.

As far as the actual code is concerned I would seek a more elegant implementation. 

# How to run
Locally on your machine, navigate to the working directory on the command line. use the command:

```node script.js```
